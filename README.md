## 📱 PHONE
 - [Enable developer mode in the target device](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+enable+developer+mode+android&t=newext&atb=v286-1&ia=web)
 - Enable `USB Debugging`
    - ![usb debugging](https://github.com/pangz-lab/adb-verus-install/blob/feature/updated-readme/scripts/readme_assets/usbdebug.png?raw=true)
    - This is the minimun setting but other phone brand might require additional setting to allow the communication with ADB.
 - Connect the phone to your PC with the data cable
 - In the first run, a message will popup asking to `Allow USB Debugging?`. Click `OK`.
    - Check `Always allow from this computer` so popup won't require confirmation the next time you connect.
